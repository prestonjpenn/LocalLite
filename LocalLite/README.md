# LocalLite

Our team developed Local Lite, a map-based mobile app that uses AI algorithms to discover and showcase small businesses in the user’s vicinity. The app’s core mission is to “make the invisible visible”, supporting local and remote communities where many independent vendors like roadside farm stands or mom-and-pop restaurants, may not have a formal presence online. Our Google Cloud Suite automatically identifies nearby small businesses and displays key details to present them in an interactive, user-friendly interface. The front end is built with Flutter for cross platform performance, while the back end is powered by Python Fast API, ensuring real time, location aware results wherever the user goes.
